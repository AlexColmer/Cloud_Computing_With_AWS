- `sudo pip3 install awscli`
- `aws configure` this is where we will type in our access key and secret key. you will also need to type in eu-west-1 and JSON to configure s3. 
- once congifured it should show any buckets that have been made 
- `aws s3 mb s3://alex-tech201` this will make our bucket 
- to create a folder use `sudo touch (name of the file)`
- to push this to s3 you need to use `aws s3 cp (file name) (name of folder you would like to copy the file) 
- just have to change the permision in aws click on the file and clikc the permision section and then click edit and chnage the permissions from there.
